# How to Create a Password on Wordpress to Access Thru The API?

Enter your wordpress with an administrator account and access the users. Select a user with administrator privileges and when in the user information scroll down until you see a topic called Application Password.

There you will need to insert an application name and when you press the button Add New Application Password a new password for the specified application/username will be created. Save that password because it will be shown only once. After that save and your wordpress is ready to submit HTTP requests to get/post/put/delete data.
